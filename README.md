# High-Scale-Streaming-Real-Time-Intelligence-Suite

Advanced patterns for Change Data Capture (CDC) and event aggregation. Solves the challenge of maintaining index freshness and feature store consistency in high-throughput messaging environments

## Projects

### 1. Member Messaging Feature Store
**Tech:** Apache Flink, Kafka (MSK-compatible), Java, Docker  

A real-time feature store that merges recent user activity and messaging history to generate unified per-member messaging features for eligibility, suppression, dashboards, and experimentation.

**Focus:** building real-time features for messaging and notification systems, so downstream systems can make instant decisions about what to send, to whom, and when.

**Use Case:** Notification Eligibility, Anti-Spam, Experimentation Features, Customer Support

### 2. High-Throughput Event Aggregator 
**Tech:** Kafka & Kotlin  

Service that consumes a high-volume stream of "transaction" events from Kafka and aggregates them into time-series windows (e.g., total spend per category every minute).

**Focus:** Implement "exactly-once" processing semantics and handle late-arriving data.

**Use Case:** Kafka and the real-time data processing that can be used for Risk and Applied AI.

### 3. Database-to-Data-Warehouse CDC Pipeline 
**Tech:** Python & Spark  

A Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline that monitors a relational database (PostgreSQL) and incrementally syncs changes to a simulated Data Lake (Parquet files) or Snowflake.

**Focus:** Schema evolution and data integrity checks.

**Use Case:** Data Integrations and Transformations

### 4. Index Freshness + Incremental Updates (CDC + Replay + Lag Monitoring)

Source DB (truth) + CDC event log with monotonically increasing offsets; Incremental indexer that consumes CDC and updates an index idempotently; Replay/backfill tooling; Freshness monitoring (lag) + health API

**Focus:** Real Time updates, reduces potential of stale updates

**Use Case:** Enables real-time access to reports i.e : “Summarize what happened in the last 10 minutes” or “Find similar incidents right now”

Why it matters: Without incremental updates, AI answers are stale; Full rebuilds are too slow + expensive
